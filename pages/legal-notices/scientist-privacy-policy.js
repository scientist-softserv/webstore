Your privacy is important to us. This Global Privacy Policy explains how The Assay Depot, Inc. (d.b.a. Scientist.com) and members of its group processes personal data and for what purposes. To learn more about Scientist.com and our group please see About Us.
INTRODUCTION

Scientist.com are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. We comply with all data protection laws, and other applicable laws which govern tracking technologies (such as "cookies"), electronic marketing and other processing of personal data applicable in each country in which we operate, (together the "Data Protection Laws").

This Global Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is collected, why we use the data we collect, when and with who we may share your personal data and the rights and choices you have in relation to your personal data.

This Global Privacy Policy applies where Scientist.com receives personal data through our interactions with you when we conduct our business. This interaction may be through our various web presences1 (our "Websites") other communication channels including email, social media, through your interaction with the services, features and content we offer through our ecommerce custom research and development platform (the "Platform") and any other platform with which we collaborate on a white label basis ("Collaborators"), when you attend one of our events, where you share data directly with us or, subject to appropriate permissions, where your data has been provided by a third party authorized to share such data with us.

This Global Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Websites and/or Platform or if our Websites and/or Platform is accessed through them.

For the purposes of this Global Privacy Policy, the personal data Scientist.com processes relates to the people we interact with, including customers, partners, clients, suppliers, vendors (or in each case the individuals representing those companies, organizations or entities) or any other person we interact with. This policy therefore does not apply to information relating to corporations, organizations or entities. This is because Data Protection Laws only apply to information relating to natural persons. Information relating to corporate bodies may still be protected by other laws such as confidentiality and we take those obligations seriously as well.

In specific countries, regions or territories in addition to the general terms there are additional terms that will apply. This Global Privacy Policy is supplemented by additional provisions that apply under local Data Protection Laws in the relevant jurisdiction. We have explicitly stated where additional rights or provisions may apply as these may vary dependent on your location.
WHO WE ARE

In this Policy, the terms "we", "our", "us" and "Scientist.com" are used to refer to The Assay Depot, Inc (d/b/a Scientist.com), a Delaware corporation with its offices at 329 S Highway 101, Suite 230, Solana Beach, CA 92075 and the members of our global group of companies.

We determine the purpose and means of processing the personal data as described in this Global Privacy Policy and where we act as the data controller / controller (or equivalent terms) for the purposes of the applicable Data Protection Laws.

If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about this Global Privacy Policy or about how your personal data is handled, please contact us through the email address or postal address stated below:

For the transaction in question to take place, we may share information relating to it with the relevant Client and Supplier.

The Collaborator shall keep such information confidential in accordance with the terms of use of the portal in question and the Supplier Letter. If you are a supplier/vendor and do not accept the terms of the Supplier Letter, please do not respond to any request from a customer/client originating from the portal in question;
    Third parties who provide supply chain financing and invoice management services to us will also have access to certain information on invoices.

These service providers shall not use such personal data for any other purposes, as governed more specifically by the terms of their agreements with us.

    External Websites: Our services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Global Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we are not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information, we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.

WHAT DO WE DO TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF USER INFORMATION?

Ensuring the security of your information is an important part of our business. We take commercially reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. In cases where we are acting as a processor, Scientist.com secures Personal Data in accordance with its contractual obligations.

We restrict access to personal data to Scientist.com and Collaborator employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information to operate, develop or improve the Website and/or Platform. These individuals are bound by strict confidentiality and may be subject to discipline if they fail to meet these obligations.

Secure software: We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

Unauthorized access: It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off from your account when finished using a shared computer. Do not share your login information with anyone else. You are responsible for protecting your username and password and must not share it with, or disclose it, to anyone.

The Internet and email are not secure. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered, may be intercepted by third parties and may not always reach the intended recipient – this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any such unauthorized access or loss of personal data that is beyond our control.
CROSS BORDER TRANSFERS OF DATA

To provide the Website, Platform and services we may access and process or through the use of our third party suppliers and partners it will be necessary to transfer and for your personal data to be processed outside of the country you are located in. Scientist.com is located in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Spain and Canada and our third party suppliers and partners are located in: United States, United Kingdom, European Economic Area, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, New Zealand. We may also transfer your personal data to other countries where you have requested services from a supplier/ vendor or because the customer/client is located in a country outside of your own location.

Such transfers may therefore be to countries where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. To effect this, we will obtain consent to such transfer from you (either directly from you or from your employer/organization who will have sought such consent from you) or where applicable, rely on legally provided transfer mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. Where you are based in the United Kingdom, Switzerland or the European Economic Area this may be the derogation of consent under Article 49 of the GDPR, or the standard contractual clauses approved by the applicable regulatory body in each such jurisdiction.
DATA RETENTION

We may retain your personal data as long as you continue to use the Websites, Platform and/or services, have an account with us and typically for seven years after the closure of your account with us, in order to enable us to deal with any issues or concerns you may have about the services or your account, and also to allow us to bring and defend legal proceedings, or for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined above. You can close your account by contacting us at the details below.

We may however retain personal data for an additional period as is permitted or required under applicable laws, for legal, contractual, tax or regulatory reasons, for legitimate and lawful business purposes and for our own internal audit and record keeping purposes.

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. We will only use personal data for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose for which it was collected where your explicit consent to the new purpose has been provided. Such consent will be obtained prior to further processing under the different purpose.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, where this is required or permitted by law.

In some circumstances, some of your personal data will be deleted in much shorter timescales, for example:

    marketing information is kept for:
        where you are a prospective supplier, vendor, customer or client or other individual who may register to use the Platform, sign up on our Websites or receive associated services –3years from the date on which the information is collected by us; and
        where you are an existing supplier, vendor, customer or client or other individual (including representatives or employees of suppliers, vendors, customers and/or clients) a period of 7 years from the end of our contractual relationship between you and us.
    cookies are refreshed in accordance with our cookies policy which can be found at https://app.scientist.com/legal-notices.
