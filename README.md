## Getting Started

  1. Confirm that your local node version is compliant with the node engine in the package.json
  2. `yarn` to install automatic dependencies
  3. `yarn dev` to boot this app as a server
      - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result
  4. Create pages by adding them to the `pages` directory
      - Reference [this documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) for more info about pages
      - The page auto-updates as you edit the file, although there may be a few seconds delay

<!-- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages. -->

### Webstore Component Library
The webstore requires a [React component library](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) of view components. That dependency is packaged and released independently.

#### Upgrading To The Latest Version
In the terminal:
``` bash
# first check for whether there is an updated version
yarn outdated @scientist-softserv/webstore-component-library # check the values under "current" and "latest"

# if there's an updated version
yarn upgrade @scientist-softserv/webstore-component-library --latest
```

#### Component Library Dev Mode
Using the local github repository requires you to manually clone the component library to your computer, build, and link it:

Preparing your local copy of the component library:

    git clone https://github.com/scientist-softserv/webstore-component-library.git
    cd webstore-component-library
    npm install
    yarn link # now there is a magic symlink in `~/.config/yarn/link` usable by the webstore app

If there are changes to the component library, you will need to rebuild in order to get the newest changes. You can either rebuild manually after changes are made, or have the webstore continually "watch" for changes:

    npm run build-lib # for a onetime build
    npm run watch-lib # for a continuous build

Back in your webstore checkout:

    yarn link "@scientist-softserv/webstore-component-library"

and your `webstore` will start using the local component build.

If you are using a local version of the component library, you will need to temporarily delete the line `"@scientist-softserv/webstore-component-library": "VERSION_HERE",` from the `package.json` file in order to see your local changes as opposed to pulling from the github package.

### Environment Variables
Configure the environment variables below in your local and published application to ensure that it works.

#### Provider
Someone with access to the api needs to visit `/providers.json?q=${YOUR_PROVIDER_NAME}` to find your provider object and id. Once found, update the variable below.

``` bash
# .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_NAME # e.g.: acme
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_ID # e.g.: 500
```

#### Authentication
All API endpoints in this app require some form of authentication. A logged out user will be able to access the home and browse pages using a provider credential, while a logged in user can access all pages using their own credentials.

##### User Credentials
``` bash
# .env.development
NEXTAUTH_SECRET # create this by running `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal
CLIENT_ID # retrieved from the provider storefront
CLIENT_SECRET # retrieved from the provider storefront
```

##### Provider Credentials
Please run the following in your terminal:
``` bash
# When replacing the variables below with your actual values,
# the following code should return something like: THISISAREALLYLONGALPHANUMERICSTRING
echo -n 'CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET' | base64

# Plug that string into the following line of code, replacing the all caps values with your actual values
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Basic THISISAREALLYLONGALPHANUMERICSTRING' -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' https://NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_NAME.scientist.com/oauth/token/
```

The curl command will return a JSON object that has an `access_token` property. Store the value of that property as shown below:

``` bash
# .env.development
NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN
```

## Linting
``` bash
# lint all files
yarn lint

# use autocorrect
yarn lint --fix
```

## Testing

This project uses both Cypress and Jest for testing.

### Jest

To run all jest tests for files you have changed, run
```
yarn jest
```

or if you want to run tests on changes, in a constant loop

```
yarn jest-watch
```

and press `a`

### Cypress
Cypress is an desktop application that runs on your computer. Cypress is already installed on this project, but your machine will need to meet certain [system requirements](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements) to run the Cypress application.

If you meet the requirements in the Cypress docs, you can run either of the cypress scripts in package.json; one runs in the cli and the other in a browser window. From the Cypress desktop app, you will be able to create and run tests.


There are 2 types of Cypress tests, e2e & component.
  - e2e: tests entire flows of the application
  - component: tests components in isolation

If you are creating an e2e test, it will live in the `cypress/e2e` directory. Component tests will need to be created in a directory called `cypress/component `

#### Setup your Cypress env variables
- the Cypress suite requires an environment variable that should be stored in your `.env.development` and not committed to git.
  - TEST_SESSION_COOKIE=
    - to get the value for this variable, open your browser to your running app at `localhost:3000`.
    - inspect the page
    - click the "Application" tab
    - click "Cookies"
    - find the value for `next-auth.session-token`
    - copy that value and paste it in the `TEST_SESSION_COOKIE` variable in your .env.development
    - do not ever commit this value
    - this value will need to be updated whenever the cookie expires, approximately once per month

<!-- ## Cutting a New Release
A git tag should exist for every release. We use `release-it` to automate the coordination of package.json and git tag.

If you want to release a new semver release run:

  ```
  yarn release # You will be prompted to select a release type, e.g. patch)
  ```

After selecting the release type you'll see the following prompts, one by one. Please respond as noted below:
``` bash
? Publish webstore to npm? # No
? Commit (Release X.X.X)? # Yes
? Tag (X.X.X)? # Yes
? Push? # Yes
```

In order to deploy this new release to staging, use the command below
``` bash
# the tag is the semver release that was created above
helm upgrade --install --kube-context=k3 --namespace=webstore-staging webstore-staging charts/webstore -f charts/webstore/values/webstore-staging.yaml --set=image.tag=X.X.X
``` -->

## Deployment
We are currently using [Vercel](www.vercel.com) to auto deploy this app to our staging environment. The `main` branch is accessible at https://webstore-staging.vercel.app.
